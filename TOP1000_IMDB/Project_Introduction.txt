Hello,

In this project I wanted to check what actors/actresses and directors/directress are the most involved in creation of the most popular TV movies*.
Additionally I wanted to check what kind of collaborations were the most successful across decades and who is the most universal/versatile in theirs profession.

*The most popular movies are based on IMDB users rating

I have used following datasets:
